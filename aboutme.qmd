Hi, I'm Murphy! I'm a first-year PhD student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and my concentration is Data Analysis and Modeling. Prior to UGA, I studied Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New Mexico. There, I joined a lab group where I got to use math and stats to research the spatial-temporal dynamics of tick-borne diseases. That's where my interest in public health started! Currently, I'm working on infectious disease modeling, specifically influenza and norovirus.

I have prior experience with a few coding languages (R, Python, MATLAB, a touch of SAS) with R being my preferred. I've completed a wide range of coursework in statistics, including Regression/ANOVA, Probability, Intro Biostatistics, and Data Analysis. I've worked on projects that have used Regression/ANOVA, survival analysis, spatial statistics, and time series methods. I'm really looking forward to this course as an opportunity to expand my data analysis skills, improve my workflow strategies, and enjoy digging into some more data! 

After working hours (#WorkLifeBalance), you can usually find me practicing hot yoga. I'm currently working on pincha pose if anyone has any tips. On the weekends, I love trekking the trails of northern Georgia. While I deeply miss the mountains in New Mexico, I've discovered some impressive waterfalls here. I also enjoy climbing and running - I ran my first half marathon in November!

I found this cool [climbing data analysis](https://medium.com/@buckthecanuck/climb-through-the-data-with-me-80fb144ea408) by Mark Dodd. He used self-reported climbing data to compile an analysis of climber demographics by max grade. There seems to be an issue with his link to the original data, but I found another version [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jordizar/climb-dataset).  I really enjoy reading and working through data analysis examples like thisâ€”it reminds me that coding is fun!
